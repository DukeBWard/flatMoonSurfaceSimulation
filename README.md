# Flat Moon Surface Simulation

## Description
This project aims to simulate a flat representation of the moon's surface, as viewed from a point on the moon. Using procedural generation techniques, it focuses on creating a dynamic and realistic terrain that resembles the moon's surface.

## Key Features
- **Flat Moon Surface Rendering**: Creates a flat 2D representation of the moon's terrain, with basic camera functionality for surface navigation.
- **Procedural Generation of Terrain**: Uses Perlin noise to generate a textured terrain, simulating craters and an uneven surface with detailed noise layers.
- **Texture Application**: Applies a moon-like texture to the surface using WebGL shaders, enhanced by basic lighting for texture details.
- **Simple Background with Stars**: Renders a starry background to simulate the view from the moon.
- **User Interaction**: Provides basic user controls for navigation (e.g., arrow keys or mouse drag).

## Technologies Used
- WebGL for rendering.
- GLSL for shader programming.
- HTML/CSS for webpage structure and styling.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup the WebGL Environment**: Initialize WebGL canvas, set up basic shaders for rendering.
2. **Create the Moon Surface**: Develop a 2D plane, apply procedural generation for terrain simulation.
3. **Add Textures and Lighting**: Load textures, implement lighting shaders for depth and realism.
4. **Implement User Controls**: Add keyboard and mouse event listeners, code camera movement logic.
5. **Finalize and Optimize**: Conduct testing and debugging, optimize for performance.
6. **Documentation and Presentation Preparation**: Document the development process, prepare presentation slides.

## Potential Challenges
- Achieving realistic terrain generation with limited experience in procedural generation.
- Balancing performance with graphical fidelity in a browser environment.


Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing Moon Surface
Research and Plan the Terrain Algorithm

Investigate procedural generation techniques suitable for terrain. Perlin noise or simplex noise are popular choices for generating natural-looking terrain.
Decide on the level of detail and scale of the terrain. For a moon surface, you might want smaller craters and an uneven surface.
Sketch a basic idea of how the terrain should look. This helps in visualizing the end goal.
Create a 2D Grid (Plane) for the Terrain

Define a grid in a 2D plane. This will be the base for applying your procedural terrain.
Decide on the resolution of the grid. A higher resolution grid allows for more detailed terrain.
Implement Procedural Generation for Terrain

Integrate a noise generation algorithm (like Perlin noise) to assign height values to each point in the grid.
Adjust parameters like frequency and amplitude to control the appearance of the terrain. For the moon, you'd want a relatively flat terrain with occasional craters.
Transform the 2D Grid into 3D Terrain

Use the noise values to modify the vertices of your 2D grid to create a 3D representation.
Each vertex's height (Z-axis value) can be set based on the noise value at that point.
Optimize the Terrain Mesh

If the terrain is too detailed, it might be heavy to render. Implement level of detail (LOD) techniques if necessary.
Consider using triangle strips for efficient memory usage and rendering.
Create and Apply a Vertex Shader

The vertex shader will process each vertex of your terrain. It should position vertices correctly based on their calculated height.
Pass the grid data (including the height) to the vertex shader.
Create and Apply a Fragment Shader

The fragment shader will color your terrain. Initially, you can use a simple color to test the terrain.
Later, you can replace this with a texture that resembles the moon's surface.
Testing and Adjustments

Test the rendering of the terrain. Look for any anomalies in the surface.
Adjust noise parameters, grid resolution, and shader effects to achieve the desired look.
Add Controls for Viewing the Terrain

Implement basic controls to navigate around the terrain. This could be as simple as rotating the scene or moving a camera.
