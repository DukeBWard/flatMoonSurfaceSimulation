# Flat Moon Surface Simulation

## Description
This project aims to simulate a flat representation of the moon's surface, as viewed from a point on the moon. Using procedural generation techniques, it focuses on creating a dynamic and realistic terrain that resembles the moon's surface.

## Key Features
- **Flat Moon Surface Rendering**: Creates a flat 2D representation of the moon's terrain, with basic camera functionality for surface navigation.
- **Procedural Generation of Terrain**: Uses Perlin noise to generate a textured terrain, simulating craters and an uneven surface with detailed noise layers.
- **Texture Application**: Applies a moon-like texture to the surface using WebGL shaders, enhanced by basic lighting for texture details.
- **Simple Background with Stars**: Renders a starry background to simulate the view from the moon.
- **User Interaction**: Provides basic user controls for navigation (e.g., arrow keys or mouse drag).

## Technologies Used
- WebGL for rendering.
- GLSL for shader programming.
- HTML/CSS for webpage structure and styling.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup the WebGL Environment**: Initialize WebGL canvas, set up basic shaders for rendering.
2. **Create the Moon Surface**: Develop a 2D plane, apply procedural generation for terrain simulation.
3. **Add Textures and Lighting**: Load textures, implement lighting shaders for depth and realism.
4. **Implement User Controls**: Add keyboard and mouse event listeners, code camera movement logic.
5. **Finalize and Optimize**: Conduct testing and debugging, optimize for performance.
6. **Documentation and Presentation Preparation**: Document the development process, prepare presentation slides.

## Potential Challenges
- Achieving realistic terrain generation with limited experience in procedural generation.
- Balancing performance with graphical fidelity in a browser environment.
